You can also create a class to organize commands or event listeners and load them later using [Pycord](https://pycord.dev) or [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).\\n\\n## Breakdown\\nLets break down a simple class of a **Car**.\\n\\n\\nSo here is our code that we\'re working with...\\n```py title=\\"car.py\\"\\nclass Car:\\n  # highlight-start\\n  def __init__(self, year, made, model): # When you use \'Car()\' you will pass\\n    # in these values that are set in the class\\n    self.year = year\\n    self.made = made\\n    self.model = model\\n  # highlight-end\\n\\n  def start(self):\\n    print(\'Vrrroooooooooommmm!!!\')\\n  \\n  def turn_off(self):\\n    print(\'*Powering down...*\')\\n\\n  def year_made(self):\\n    return self.year\\n\\n  def month_made(self):\\n    return self.made\\n\\n  def show_model(self):\\n    return self.model\\n\\n# highlight-start\\nmy_car = Car(2000, \'December\', \'Lexus\') # Create the car from the class\\n# Setting the year to 2000, the month to \'December\' and\\n# and the model to \'Lexus\'\\n# highlight-end\\nmy_car.start() # >>> \'Vrrroooooooooommmm!!!\'\\nmy_car.year_made() # >>> 2022\\nmy_car.show_model() # >>> \'Lexus\'\\nmy_car.month_made() # >>> \'December\'\\nmy_car.turn_off() # >>> \'*Powering down...*\'\\n```\\n\\nThe class <span className=\\"timestamp\\">Car</span> has some functions being <span className=\\"timestamp\\">start</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">turn_off</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">year_made</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">month_made</span>, and <span className=\\"timestamp\\">show_model</span>. All of these functions return or print a value from the class, the values being the attributes of the class (<span className=\\"timestamp\\">year</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">made</span>, and <span className=\\"timestamp\\">model</span>). You can access these attributes by doing `car.year`, etc.\\n\\nIf you\'re using **Pycord** or **discord.py** it would look something like this...\\n\\n```py title=\\"mycog.py\\"\\nimport discord\\nfrom discord.ext import commands\\n\\nclass MyCog(commands.Cog):\\n  def __init__(self, bot):\\n    self.bot = bot # you can access your bot object here\\n  \\n  ### stuff ###\\n\\ndef setup(bot):\\n  bot.add_cog(MyCog(bot))\\n```\\n\\nThen in your main.py or bot.py file...\\n```py title=\\"main.py\\"\\n# ...\\n\\n# if you have your cog file in a \'cogs\' folder:\\nbot.load_extension(\'cogs.mycog\')\\n# if you don\'t:\\nbot.load_extension(\'mycog\')\\n```\\n\\n## Functions Setting Attributes\\nYou can even make functions to set attributes within the class.\\n\\n```py title=\\"car.py\\"\\nclass Car:\\n  def __init__(self, year, made, model):\\n    self.year = year\\n    self.made = made\\n    self.model = model\\n\\n  def start(self):\\n    print(\'Vrrroooooooooommmm!!!\')\\n  \\n  def turn_off(self):\\n    print(\'*Powering down...*\')\\n\\n  def year_made(self):\\n    return self.year\\n\\n  def month_made(self):\\n    return self.made\\n\\n  def show_model(self):\\n    return self.model\\n\\n  # highlight-start\\n  def set_year(self, year):\\n    self.year = year\\n    print(f\'Set year to: {year}\')\\n  # highlight-end\\n\\nmy_car = Car(2000, \'December\', \'Lexus\')\\n# highlight-start\\nmy_car.year_made() # >>> 2000\\nmy_car.set_year(2005) # >>> \'Set year to: 2005\'\\nmy_car.year_made() # >>> 2005\\n# highlight-end\\n```\\n\\n<div className=\\"box red animation no-background\\">\\n<div className=\\"title\\">\\nWarning\\n</div>\\nMake sure you have correct syntax in or you will get an error!\\n</div>"},{"id":"break","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/break","source":"@site/blog/2022-9-18-break.md","title":"A break from Discord","description":"Update","date":"2022-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 18, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":2.22,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nziie","title":"who?","url":"https://nziie.is-a.dev","imageURL":"https://github.com/Nzii3.png","key":"nziie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"break","title":"A break from Discord","authors":"nziie"},"prevItem":{"title":"Python Classes & Usages","permalink":"/blog/python-classes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Wumpus Advertisements Mod Guide","permalink":"/blog/wa-moderation"}},"content":"<div className=\\"box blurple animation no-background\\">\\n<div className=\\"title\\">\\nUpdate\\n</div>\\nBack as of 9-25\\n</div>\\n\\nHey everyone, I\'d just like to brief you on the **1-2 week** (maybe longer) break I am going to be starting on 9/19/2022 (Sunday PST). \\n\\nI have taken it upon myself to decide to take a **1-2 week** break from Discord for my own good. I\'ve realized that it\'s taken control over my life because of how many projects I manage. I\'m starting to see how it can negatively affect my physical and mental health. In myself, i\'ve seen a decline in my mental health, I used to go out with friends and stuff but now that dopamine is starting to take control of my actions, it\'s noticeable. I\'m definitely not as productive as I was a month ago - and I think to get there I need to step away from the productivity. \\n\\n:::caution Warning\\n\\nI will be deleting Discord off my phone and will be unplugging my PC so that it\'s not tempting to touch Discord. So I won\'t get **ANY** notifications.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nTherefore, I am going to be a **Dopamine Detox**. Dopamine is essentially a __chemical in your brain that is released when you do go on social media (Discord), listen to music, eat junk food or sweets, and other things that can be bad for you__. So, I will not be on Discord or social media for 1-2 weeks (not sure the duration). I know this may be bad timing since some of you are requesting features for your bots. All I\'m asking is just 2 weeks so that I can get rid of my dopamine and I\'ll be very productive. If I continue like this, I don\'t see great actions from me and possibly depression, which I don\'t want. Listening to music is going to be the hardest but I think I can do it. This is an oppurtunity for me to get my life straight and to stop worrying about Discord even when I\'m in a damn math class.\\n\\nI will be starting my detox **tomorrow** morning and it will last either 1 or 2 weeks, I\'m not sure. If im not back within 2 weeks please just don\'t panic I may just want to take a longer break because it\'s working or I may need more time. Anyway, I\'d like to thank everyone and hope you understand.\\n\\n:::info \\"Dopamine\\" - by Google\\nDopamine is a type of neurotransmitter and hormone. It plays a role in many important body functions, including movement, memory and pleasurable reward and motivation. High or low levels of dopamine are associated with several mental health and neurological diseases.\\n:::"},{"id":"wa-moderation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wa-moderation","source":"@site/blog/2022-9-4-wa-mod-guide.md","title":"Wumpus Advertisements Mod Guide","description":"Tasks","date":"2022-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 4, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Guides","permalink":"/blog/tags/guides"},{"label":"Wumpus Advertisements","permalink":"/blog/tags/wumpus-advertisements"}],"readingTime":1.385,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nziie","title":"who?","url":"https://nziie.is-a.dev","imageURL":"https://github.com/Nzii3.png","key":"nziie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"wa-moderation","title":"Wumpus Advertisements Mod Guide","authors":"nziie","tags":["Guides","Wumpus Advertisements"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A break from Discord","permalink":"/blog/break"},"nextItem":{"title":"First blog post","permalink":"/blog/first"}},"content":"import Tabs from \\"@theme/Tabs\\";\\nimport TabItem from \\"@theme/TabItem\\";\\nimport Button from \'../src/components/Button\';\\nimport {\\n  DiscordButton,\\n  DiscordButtons,\\n  DiscordInteraction,\\n  DiscordMessage,\\n  DiscordMessages,\\n  DiscordMention,\\n} from \\"discord-message-components/packages/react\\";\\nimport \\"discord-message-components/packages/react/dist/style.css\\";\\nimport DiscordComponent, { defaultOptions } from \\"../src/components/DiscordComponent\\";\\n\\n## Tasks\\n--- \\n\\n- Send 10 messages in the main server\\n- Issue **5** valid advertisements warnings\\n\\n## Advertisement Warnings {#ad-warnings}\\n---\\nAdvertisement warnings are our form of verbal warnings for advertisements. \\n\\n### Example\\n---\\n<DiscordComponent>\\n  <DiscordMessage profile=\\"nziie\\">\\n    .warn <DiscordMention highlight={false}>{defaultOptions.profiles.member.author}</DiscordMention> ?s aw ?c <span className=\\"mention\\">#\ud83c\udfe0\u30fbcommunity-servers</span> ?r Lack of description\\n  </DiscordMessage>\\n  <DiscordMessage profile=\\"wumpusmanager\\">\\n    <DiscordMention highlight={false}>{defaultOptions.profiles.member.author}</DiscordMention> has been warned <DiscordMention highlight={true}>{defaultOptions.profiles.nziie.author}</DiscordMention> for a severity of: <code>Advertisement Warning</code>\\n    <br/>\\n    They now have <code>1</code> warning(s) in that category, and <code>1</code> total warnings.\\n  </DiscordMessage>\\n</DiscordComponent>\\n\\n## Moderation\\n---\\nPlease make sure to use command flags correctly and use commands correctly.\\n\\n### Commands\\n---\\n| Usage | Description |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| * <code>.warn &lt;member&gt;
