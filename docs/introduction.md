Hey, I'm Nziie (en-zee). IRL, I'm just a 14 year old male in school. I'm my school's drone operator, meaning for our school's news I record stuff events, drone 'montages' and sunset time lapses for my school and other schools in the school district with my personal drone. At some point, I may put some of my drone time lapses here but it's not that big of a deal to me.

I also play football IRL and I'm part German by genetics - don't know if that's interesting :/.
