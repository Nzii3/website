Hey, I'm Nziie (en-zee). IRL, I'm just a 15 year old male in high school. I play football, I love flying & building FPV drones ([1](https://youtu.be/LWsAbG3pAxQ), [2](https://youtu.be/NcBjx_eyvxc), [3](https://youtu.be/1U2aVQDbJ3o)), and I love coding.

## Custom Discord Bots
In partnership with [AnonDev](https://anondev.ml), I offer cheap hosting for the custom bots on powerful servers with good uptime. **If you are interested in getting custom bot from me, please join [my Discord server](/discord.html) and open ticket**.

## BumpYourServer (5k+ servers)
BumpYourServer is an effective and easy-to-use Discord bot designed to boost and market your servers across different platforms. By creating a designated bump channel, you can actively engage in server promotion. Our team carefully moderates all servers that are bumped to guarantee compliance with our Terms of Service, as well as Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. If any issues escape our attention, users can report problematic servers to us, and we will swiftly address violations in server behavior and descriptions.
