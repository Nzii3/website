<div className="box blurple shadow no-background" style={{'margin-top': '0'}}>
  <strong>Last Updated:</strong> <p>5/10/2023</p>
</div>

<br/>

<span className="rulenum">1.</span> You, your server, and your bot should be following <a href="https://discord.com/terms" className="discord-link">Discord's Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" className="discord-link">Discord's Community Guidelines</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service" className="discord-link">Discord's Developer Policy</a> at all times.
<br/>
<br/>
<span className="rulenum">2.</span> Features/source code requested by you can be denied at any time without reason.
<br/>
<br/>
<span className="rulenum">3.</span> You <strong>must</strong> remain in the development server (Nziie Development) for your bot to be online. If you leave the server at any time your bot will go offline until you join back with no refund given.
<br/>
<br/>
<span className="rulenum">4.</span> Please do not rush me, I may cancel your services without a full refund if you rush me too much. You can be patient like every other client. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span className="rulenum">5.</span> Product prices changes may occur while you're an existing client. Your payment may be adjusted to that new price or a little bit lower. Priority Clients bypass any product price changes, meaning what you purchase, is what you pay. Prices may change to meet the demand of purchases or total resource costs. If the price changes on your product and you see a chance on your next invoice, you may open a ticket in the [development server](https://nziie.is-a.dev/discord) if you'd like to negotiate with me to get your renewal price lower.

## Refunds
<span className="rulenum">1.</span> If you request a refund for your bot, it can be denied at any time without reason.
<br/>
<br/>
<span className="rulenum">2.</span> Refunds may never be given under any circumstance due to hosting costs real money and hosting can't be "refunded."

## Source Code Guidelines
<div className="box red animation no-background">

</div>
<br/>
‚≠ê <span className="rulenum">1.</span> You <span className="rulenum" style={{'font-size': '120%'}}>MUST</span> keep credit in the code in some commands/features in the source code you are given. If you remove ANY credit whatsoever you will no longer be able to recieve source code and will be removed from the development server with any services purchased being canceled. The source code you are given may be connected to an API and can detect if credit was removed, and <u>if credit is removed the bot will not start or the feature(s) won't work.</u>
