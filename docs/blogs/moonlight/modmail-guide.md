## Modmail Commands
|     Usage               |  Description   |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| <span className="mention">![reply\|r] &lt;message&gt</span> | Reply to a modmail thread (this is an anonymous reply) |
| <span className="mention">![close\|c] <a></a>[time] <a></a>[message]</span> | Close a thread with an optional duration to wait to close the thread (timed close) - `message` will appear on the user's end. This can be 'Have a great day' |
| <span className="mention">!alert [member]</span> | Notify yourself or another member of the next thread messaged received |


## Snippet Commands
|     Usage               |  Description   |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| <code>![snippet\|s] <a></a>[name] </code> | View all the snippets or send one in the thread by providing `name` |
| <code>![snippet\|s] add &lt;name&gt &lt;value&gt</code> | (Admins Only) Add a snippet |
| <code>![snippet\|s] remove &lt;name&gt </code> | (Admins Only) Remove/delete a snippet |

## Modmail Rules
**1.** When a thread is made, all online staff will get pinged. **To claim a thread, use the `!claim` command**, other staff should obey that you claimed the thread. If you‚Äôre inactive in a thread for a few hours when a user responds, they have the right to 'overclaim.'

**2.** There is such a thing as "over-claiming" where you claim a claimed thread. **You can only overclaim if you are a management member and need your serious intervention**, you were asked by the person who originally claimed the ticket to claim or if the person who claimed it isn't responding to your ping after 6 hours. Overclaim for no good reason will get you a strike or your modmail permissions revoked for a duration of time.

**3.** When handling a thread, **remain professional at all times**. **Don't use shortened words** such as "**k**" or "**xD**" or "**lol**". That doesn't look very professional. With this, capitalization and grammar must be used as well. 

**4.** <u>Stay respectful at all times</u>. Everyone must be treated with respect regardless of their words. In this case, ping an online management member.

**5.** If someone reported a member, you aren't supposed to be sharing the actions. Use the proper snippets according to the situation. You may not tell a thread user **any** actions against anyone. If you do this, you may receive a staff strike or your modmail license will be **revoked**.

## Claiming

When a thread is created, you have the ability to claim it as yours so no other staff member can respond to the thread but you.

| Usage | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| <code>!claim</code> | Claim a thread |
| <code>!unclaim</code> | Unclaim a thread |
| <code>!overclaim</code> | <strong>(Management Only)</strong> Over claim a thread |

<div className="box yellow no-background">
Management can only over claim to prevent abuse. It may be released to all of the Modmail Team eventually.
</div>
