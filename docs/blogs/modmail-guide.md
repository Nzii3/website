:::note Overview

In this guide you will learn how to use and operate **all modmail bots** made by me (vNziie--#7777). 

:::

<details className="customdetails">
<summary>üîë Key</summary>

> `<prefix>` - This should be the prefix of the modmail bot you are using (e.g. `.` `!` `?` `-`)

> `[foo|bar]` - Text separated in brackets means you can use either **foo** or **bar** to get the same command result

> `[arg=value]` - An argument in brackets means this is an **optional argument**, if it's not provided a default value of '**value**' will take it's place

> `<arg>` - An argument in less and greater than signs means that this is a **required argument**, it must be provided or the command will fail

</details>

## Modmail Commands
|     Usage               |  Description   |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| <code>&lt;prefix&gt[reply\|r] &lt;message&gt</code> | Reply to a modmail thread (this is an anonymous reply) |
| <code>&lt;prefix&gt[close\|c] <a></a>[time] <a></a>[message]</code> | Close a thread with an optional duration to wait to close the thread (timed close) - `message` will appear on the user's end. This can be 'Have a great day' |
| <code>&lt;prefix&gtalert [member]</code> | Notify yourself or another member of the next thread messaged received |
| <code>&lt;prefix&gtmove &lt;name&gt</code> | Move a thread to a category by name |

:::tip
`category_name` can be a shorthand word of a category name.

For example, you can use `.move moderation` to move a thread to the moderation team.

## Snippet Commands

## Moving Threads

You can move threads to other modmail categories with `<prefix>move <category_name>`. `category_name` can be a shorthand name of a category name. For example:
*(example prefix: `!`)*
<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="nziie">
    !move moderation
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="modmail">
    ‚úÖ Successfully moved this thread to <code>Moderation Team</code>!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>
<br/>
<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="nziie">
    !move partnership
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="modmail">
    ‚úÖ Successfully moved this thread to <code>Partnership Team</code>!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>
<br/>

This guide is not completely done yet as more feature to modmail will be added eventually.
