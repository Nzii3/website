## Modmail Commands
|     Usage               |  Description   |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| <code>.[reply\|r] &lt;message&gt</code> | Reply to a modmail thread (this is an anonymous reply) |
| <code>.[close\|c] <a></a>[time] <a></a>[message]</code> | Close a thread with an optional duration to wait to close the thread (timed close) - `message` will appear on the user's end. This can be 'Have a great day' |
| <code>.alert [member]</code> | Notify yourself or another member of the next thread messaged received |
| <code>.move &lt;name&gt</code> | Move a thread to a category by name |

:::tip
`category_name` can be a shorthand word of a category name.

For example, you can use `.move moderation` to move a thread to the moderation team.

## Snippet Commands
|     Usage               |  Description   |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| <code>.[snippet\|s] <a></a>[name] </code> | View all the snippets or send one in the thread by providing `name` |
| <code>.[snippet\|s] add &lt;name&gt &lt;value&gt</code> | (Management Only) Add a snippet |
| <code>.[snippet\|s] remove &lt;name&gt </code> | (Management Only) Remove/delete a snippet |

## Modmail Rules
**1.** When a thread is made, all online staff will get pinged. **To claim a thread, simply say 'mine'**, other staff should obey that you claimed the thread. If you‚Äôre inactive in a thread for a few hours when a user responds, they have the right to 'overclaim.'

**2.** There is such a thing as "over-claiming" where you claim a claimed thread. **You can only overclaim if you are a management member and need your serious intervention**, you were asked by the person who originally claimed the ticket to claim or if the person who claimed it isn't responding to your ping after 6 hours. Overclaim for no good reason will get you a strike or your modmail permissions revoked for a duration of time.

**3.** When handling a thread, **remain professional at all times**. **Don't use shortened words** such as "**k**" or "**xD**" or "**lol**". That doesn't look very professional. With this, capitalization and grammar must be used as well. 

**4.** <u>Stay respectful at all times</u>. Everyone must be treated with respect regardless of their words. In this case, ping an online management member.

**5.** If someone reported a member, you aren't supposed to be sharing the actions. Use the proper snippets according to the situation. You may not tell a thread user **any** actions against anyone. If you do this, you may receive a staff strike or your modmail license will be **revoked**.

**6.** Move a thread to the correct team category with `.move <team>`. Please don't handle threads that aren't for your department.
