<details className="customdetails">
<summary>Command Explanation</summary>

The `/adwarn` command sends a message in the <span className="mention">#üö®Ô∏±open-moderation</span> channel and is stored in the database of **Molten's Utilities**. A **warning ID** is random generated ID which is _12 characters long_. This ID is unique to every advertisement warning, users can find this ID at the embed footer of the ad warning message *and* direct message they get. Users can message the modmail bot <span className="mention">@Molten Support#3319</span> to appeal this warning. These warnings are stored for **7 days** then removed (expired). Users are notified of this expiration.

<details className="customdetails">
<summary>Command Arguments</summary>

*These are the arguments that aren't self explanatory*

> `belongs_to_channel` - This argument is only required and used when you use the `Incorrect Channel` preset reason. This is the channel the advertisement would belong to.

> `notes` - This argument is displayed as an embed field on the ad warning embed. This is typically not used unless you need to provide more context. **Example below**.
