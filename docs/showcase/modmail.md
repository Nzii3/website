My modmail system features a feature-rich support system that helps server members get in contact with staff easier than ever. Using Discord UI (buttons and more) to make sure threads are *squeaky clean* üßΩ.

## Main Functionality

With a choice of either slash commands or prefix commands, you can choose how much Discord UI the bot uses. Slash commands may provide an easier UI, but prefix commands are more light-weight and are better supported on all devices and all types of devices (PC, Mobile, iOS, Android, Samsung, etc.).

<h3>Slash commands</h3>
<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="modmail" avatar="blue">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction profile="nziie" command>
        reply
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    <DiscordEmbed authorIcon="/img/logo.png" authorName="vNziie--#7777" borderColor="#2ecc71" timestamp="12/24/2022">
      Hello, what can we assist you with today?
      <span slot="footer">Anonymous Reply</span>
    </DiscordEmbed>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>
<h3>Prefix commands</h3>

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="nziie">
  .reply Hello, what can we assist you with today?
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="modmail" avatar="blue">
    <DiscordEmbed authorIcon="/img/logo.png" authorName="vNziie--#7777" borderColor="#2ecc71" timestamp="12/24/2022">
      Hello, what can we assist you with today?
      <span slot="footer">Anonymous Reply</span>
    </DiscordEmbed>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

## Snippets
Snippets are pre-defined text shortcuts for you to use on the fly while replying to a thread. Snippets help take away the time of writing out a long message over and over again.

### Adding a snippet {#adding-snippets}

<h4>Slash commands</h4>

Use the <span className="mention">/snippet add</span> slash command and provide the `name` and `value` arguments.

<h4>Prefix commands</h4>

Use `.snippet add`
<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="nziie">
  .snippet add morehelp Is there anything else we can help you with today?
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="modmail" avatar="blue">
    ‚úÖ Successfully added snippet!
    <br/>
    <blockquote>
    <strong>Name:</strong> morehelp
    <br/>
    <strong>Value:</strong> Is there anything else we can help you with today?
    </blockquote>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

### Deleting a snippet {#deleting-snippets}

<h4>Slash commands</h4>

Use the <span className="mention">/snippet remove</span> slash command and provide the `name` argument of the snippet you'd like to delete.

<h4>Prefix commands</h4>

Use `.snippet delete`
<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="nziie">
  .snippet delete morehelp
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="modmail" avatar="blue">
    üóë Successfully deleted the snippet named <code>morehelp</code>!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

## Moving Threads {#moving}

Having different categories to move a thread to is helpful for categorizing threads in to where they belong (e.g. Moderation, Partnership, etc.). To move a thread with a slash command, use <span className="mention">/move</span>. To move a thread with prefix commands, use the `.move` command.
