üéüÔ∏è **Tickets v2** uses the [configs v2](./configs-v2.md) system to maximize your control over how the system acts and responds. With this system, you can give your server members an easy way to get in contact with your staff team. Give your members the fast support they deserve. This system is inspired by my old public ticket bot, **Ticket System**, but simplified.

## Features

- Simplified ticket management
- Simplified ticket handler
- Support for [multiple ticket categories](#ticket-categories) on one panel
- Ticket panels
- [Beautified ticket logging](#ticket-logging)
