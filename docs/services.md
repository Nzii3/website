## Info
I offer custom Discord bots. You can contact me in my Discord server - [Nziie's Development](/discord.html). 

I code all Discord bots in Python ([Pycord](https://pycord.dev) - discord.py v2 fork). The bots are hosted on powerful servers with good uptime.

## Bot plans (tiers)
### Basic Plan
This plan is mainly for small bots and a good amount of features, may be slower compared to the other plans' specs.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="_price" label="Price" default>
    <strong>($4.20/3.85â‚¬) / 3 months ($1.4 / month)</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_ram" label="RAM">
    <strong>128 MB</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_cpu" label="CPU %">
    <strong>15% CPU</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_disk" label="Disk Space">
    <strong>450 MB</strong>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div className="pyc-hero__actions">
  <Button link="https://redirect.nziie.is-a.dev/purchase-basic" class="basicplanbutton">Purchase</Button>
</div>

### Advanced Plan
This is plan runs more complex bots better than the [basic plan](#basic-plan). This would be good for a bot that relies on Discord events, such as Modmail (for listening to messages). I personally suggest you to pick this plan, most of our clients have this.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="_price" label="Price" default>
    <strong>($6.17/5.65â‚¬)/ 3 months ($2 / month)</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_ram" label="RAM">
    <strong>256 MB</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_cpu" label="CPU %">
    <strong>30% CPU</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_disk" label="Disk Space">
    <strong>950 MB</strong>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div className="pyc-hero__actions">
  <Button link="https://redirect.nziie.is-a.dev/purchase-advanced">Purchase</Button>
</div>

### Premium Plan
This plan is great for all complicated bots, much faster than all the other plans.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="_price" label="Price" default>
    <strong>($9.44/8.65â‚¬) / 3 months ($3.06 / month)</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_ram" label="RAM">
    <strong>512 MB</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_cpu" label="CPU %">
    <strong>50% CPU</strong>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_disk" label="Disk Space">
    <strong>1024 MB</strong>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div className="pyc-hero__actions">
  <Button link="https://redirect.nziie.is-a.dev/purchase-modmail-v3">Purchase</Button>
</div>
<br/>

<div className="box yellow animation no-background">

You are not required to provide all personal information to us on register page. Just First name (you can enter there nickname), Email address, Discord Username with tag form fields are required on the checkout (register) page.
</div>


## Extra Options
Here you can find list of extra (configurable options). If you are interested in some of these extra options for your bot, please let me know by opening a ticket in my [development server](/discord.html). You can purchase extra options anytime (both for new and existing bots).

### White labelling 
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="_custom-about-me" label="Custom About Me section">
    <p>With this, you can set your custom message in about me section for the bot (you can also remove link to vNziie's website)</p>
    <p>Price: <strong>$3.0 / 3 months ($1.0 / month)</strong></p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="_whitelabel" label="Whitelabel bot (own application)" default>
    <p>You will need to make your own application on <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Dev Portal</a> and enable all intents. You will also need to provide your bot token to vNziie. This allows you to change bot username, avatar, about me section, etc. on your own. Good for those who want to act that it's their own bot.</p>
  <p>Price: <strong>$5.0 / 3 months ($1.66 / month)</strong></p>
  </TabItem>
